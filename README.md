This project is completed under instructions from Season 2 of Mini Beginner's Crash Course to Elasticsearch and Kibana:
https://dev.to/lisahjung/beginners-guide-to-building-a-full-stack-app-nodejs-react-with-elasticsearch-5347

It is a full stack app (Node.js and React) with Elasticsearch allows users to search earthquake results by the type of earthquake, magnitude level, location, date range, and sort the result by magnitude.

In this project, I learned:
1. Build a server using Node.js with Express
2. Create an Elastic Cloud deployment
3. Securely connect Node.js server to Elastic Cloud
4. Plan for efficient data storage and search performance in Elasticsearch
5. Set up Elasticsearch for data transformation and data ingestion
6. Set up the Node.js server to retrieve API data and send the data to Elasticsearch
7. Build the client side of the app with React
8. Set up Node.js server to handle Elasticsearch requests

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
